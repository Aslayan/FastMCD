# The performance of MCD Estimators from FastMCD algorithm in Linear Discriminant Analysis

The minimum covariance determinant (MCD) method of Rousseeuw is a highly robust estimator of multivariate location and scatter. Its objective is to find h observations (out of n) whose covariance matrix has the lowest determinant.
